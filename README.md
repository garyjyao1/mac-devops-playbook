# Mac DevOps' Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures software I use on my Mac for work.

- [Battleschool](http://spencer.gibb.us/blog/2014/02/03/introducing-battleschool) is the first thing bring this to mind. But as I am learning Ansible and I like to do thing my own, I will just leave it for now.
- [geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mac-dev-playbook) is where most code based from.
